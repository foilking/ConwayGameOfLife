# Conway's Game of Life
Simple C# implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Created mostly during a coding test; refined to add build parameter to allow for continuously running the program and to include color on the console. Pass in `true` on run to have the program run continuously.
